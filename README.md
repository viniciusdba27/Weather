run: npm run start

test: npm run test

This is a MVP:

does not include:

- localization
- fancy styling
- http error handling
- integration tests
- not presenting dogs and cats (if it's really necessary then I can do it later), showing weather icons instead
- not considering local timezone of the City (could be in the past)
